## Attribution

The exercises and skeleton code in each sub-repository were originally provided by **Technical University of Munich** as part of the coursework for _Introduction to Deep Learning_ (Summer 2021) during my master's degree.

All modifications, solutions, and additional code are my own work, implemented to fulfill the requirements of the assignments.
